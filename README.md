Chinese Flashcards
=================
I would like to help my kids learn their chinese words, but could not find a simple flashcard app that is aligned with Singapore MOE. So I made this at https://edyeo82.github.io/chineseflashcard/

This is a simple web-based flashcard application to help you learn Chinese characters and their Pinyin pronunciations. It uses characters from Singapore MOE Higher Chinese. Chinese chars are parsed from https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/primary/2015characterlistprimaryhigherchinese.pdf

How to Access
-------------
- **Desktop**: Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended) or visit the deployed URL (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- **Mobile (iPhone)**: Visit the deployed URL via Safari/Chrome or use a local server (ask the developer for setup).

Features
--------
- Choose a Primary level (e.g., Primary 1A) and lesson (or "All Lessons") using dropdown menus.
- Two display modes:
  - **Both**: Shows the Chinese character and Pinyin together.
  - **Character**: Shows only the character; flip to reveal Pinyin.
- Navigate through cards using buttons, arrow keys, or swipes.
- No progress bars, audio, or color feedback.
